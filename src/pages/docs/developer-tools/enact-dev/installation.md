title: Installing enact-dev
---
## Requirements

Node 6.4 or later.

## Installation via NPM

All that's needed to install enact-dev is to use npm to install it globally. For Linux `sudo` may be required.

```
npm install -g enact-dev
```

This preceding command will install the latest stable version.  You can also use tagged versions (for example `enyojs/enact-dev#0.3.0`) or the potentially-unstable development branch (`enyojs/enact-dev#develop`).
